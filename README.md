Advinas is a Discord Bot which collects data from the Infinitode 2 API and shows it in easily accessible commands on discord.

Add the bot to your own server using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=824289599065030756&permissions=309238025280&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

**IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE INFINITODE API COMMUNICATION**

I moved the API wrapper to its own [repository](https://github.com/Sprylos/infinitode.py)

It is completely typed and documented.


## Future Plans
