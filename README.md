Advinas is a Discord Bot which collects data from the Infinitode 2 API and shows it in easily accessible commands on discord.

Add the bot to your own server using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=824289599065030756&permissions=309238025280&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

## Future Plans

-   Customizable Profile Command (Background, Grid, etc.)
-   Music Player within Discord Voice Channels
-   Fully functional Tag System
-   Seperate Infinitode API package
-   Automatic Run tracking and stats commands
-   Database optimizations and performance
